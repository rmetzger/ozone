<div class="lead">Students: Apply now for exciting summer projects in the Big Data / Analytics field</div>

We are pleased to announce that Stratosphere got accepted to [Google Summer of Code 2014](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) as a mentoring organization. This means that we will host a bunch of students to conduct projects within Stratosphere over the summer. [Read more on the GSoC manual for students](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/) and the [official FAQ](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page). Students can improve their coding skills, learn to work with open-source projects, improve their CV and get a nice paycheck from Google.

If you are an interested student, check out our [idea list](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2014) in the wiki. It contains different projects with varying ranges of difficulty and requirement profiles. Students can also suggest their own projects.

We welcome students to sign up at our [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stratosphere-dev) to discuss their ideas.
Applying students can use our wiki (create a new page) to create a project proposal. We are happy to have a look at it.
