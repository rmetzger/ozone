We are happy to announce that Stratosphere has been accepted as a project for the [Apache Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/). The [proposal](https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/StratosphereProposal) has been accepted by the Incubator PMC members earlier this week. The Apache Incubator is the first step in the process of giving a project to the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org). While under incubation, the project will move to the Apache infrastructure and adopt the community-driven development principles of the Apache Foundation. Projects can graduate from incubation to become top-level projects if they show activity, a healthy community dynamic, and releases.

We are glad to have Alan Gates as champion on board, as well as a set of great mentors, including Sean Owen, Ted Dunning, Owen O'Malley, Henry Saputra, and Ashutosh Chauhan. We are confident that we will make this a great open source effort.
