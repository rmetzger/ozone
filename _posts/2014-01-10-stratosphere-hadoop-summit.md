The Stratosphere team is proud to announce that it is going to present at the [Hadoop Summit 2014 in Amsterdam](http://hadoopsummit.org/amsterdam/) on April 2-3. Our talk "Big Data looks tiny from Stratosphere" is part of the "Future of Hadoop" Track. The talk abstract already made it into the top 5 in the [Community Vote](https://hadoopsummit.uservoice.com/forums/196822-future-of-apache-hadoop/filters/top) that took place by the end of last year.
