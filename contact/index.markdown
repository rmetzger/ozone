Send us an email to <a href="mailto:contact@getstratosphere.org">contact@getstratosphere.org</a>.

### Mailing List

We have two mailing lists: one for **users** running Stratosphere and the other one for **developers**. You can ask questions by sending an email to one of the following adresses:

  - **Users**: stratosphere-users@googlegroups.com ([https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stratosphere-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stratosphere-users))
  - **Developers**: stratosphere-dev@googlegroups.com ([https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stratosphere-dev/subscribe](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stratosphere-dev/subscribe))

**The *users* list does not require signup to ask questions (just send an email), whereas the *dev* list does. Sign up by following the link to Google.**

To **unsubscribe**, send an email to *stratosphere-users+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com* or *stratosphere-dev+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com* respectively.


Use the *users* mailing list for all general questions, e.g. how to run the system or best development practices. Please report bugs in the *developer* mailing list.

### GitHub

[Open an Issue](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/issues) on our [GitHub](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere) page for bugs, documentation or website issues.

### Official
