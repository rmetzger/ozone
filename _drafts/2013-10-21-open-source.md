In the past few weeks, we have have been working hard to make the system more accessible and developer-friendly. The changes include

1. a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stratosphere-dev) to easily get in touch with us,
2. centralization of all the code to a single GitHub account [@stratosphere](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere), and
3. reworking the website with a focus on new users and developers.

Lets take a more detailed look.

## Communication and Transparency

Stratosphere has been a scientific research project for more than five years. Many smart PhD students at different universities have worked really hard on the project with the goal of creating a cutting-edge Big Data Analytics platform.

So far the decisions about changes and new features were based on the research focus of the involved people. The primary goal was to conduct and publish world class database research. While this lead to some impressive [publications](http://stratosphere.eu/publications/) these mechanisms were not transparent for external users.

In order to change this, we have decided to separate the research efforts and the Open Source project. This will allow both the Open Source community and researchers to benefit. Open Source developers can build upon the latest world class database research results while our researchers have a stable basis for their work. All changes and features will be discussed and decided in public on GitHub or the mailing list. 

## New Website and Blog

Since you are reading this post, you should already know our website. It now focuses more on what new users need to understand to adopt our system:

1. [Overview](http://stratosphere.eu) of our main features,
2. a [Quick Start](http://stratosphere.eu/quickstart) guide, and
3. user and developer [documentation](http://stratosphere.eu/docs).

The blog will keep you informed about the latest developments and include tutorials. Expect introductions to major features with background material in the future!

## Tooling and Usability

Besides the improved communication tools (website, blog, mailing list, GitHub), we are also working on a more convenient start into the world of Stratosphere.

Our code is pushed to Maven repositories so you will not need to download, install and import our project. You can just get started!

We will put more efforts into this direction with sample VMs, quickstart helpers and improved documentation.

Please use the comments for any suggestions on how we can further improve the experience of Stratosphere!
