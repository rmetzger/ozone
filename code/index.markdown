## Building Stratosphere from scratch

We keep our development version always as stable as possible, so it's a viable option if you want to start using the system.

Get the source:
You can download the code here: [Download zip](https://github.com/dimalabs/ozone/archive/master.zip) or use Git, if you want to track our changes:

    git clone https://github.com/dimalabs/ozone.git

Go to the Stratosphere directory:

    cd ozone

And build the project using Maven

    mvn -DskipTests clean package # this will take up to 5 minutes

Stratosphere is now installed in `stratosphere-dist/target`
If you’re a Debian/Ubuntu user, you’ll find a .deb package. We will continue with the generic case.

    cd stratosphere-dist/target/stratosphere-dist-0.2-ozone-bin/stratosphere-0.2-ozone/

The directory structure here looks like the contents of an official release distribution.

Please refer to our [README](https://github.com/dimalabs/ozone/blob/master/README.md) for further instructions on running your first code.

	<b>What is the difference between Stratosphere and Ozone?</b>
	<br>
	Stratosphere is the official name of the University research project. Many different (incompatible) versions of Stratosphere existed during the time of University research. This is why we decided to build Ozone, which is stable and transparently developed to the public, so that others in the open source community can participate.
