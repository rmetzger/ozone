    <p> "A social network for researchers? Forget it, that’s
      impossible. Researchers aren’t social" – that’s what Ijad Madisch’s
      professor at the University in Hanover, Germany, told him when he
      proposed his idea for ResearchGate. Five years later over three
      million researchers use the network to collaborate worldwide, share
      results and build a reputation to find cures for diseases and
      solutions to the world energy crisis faster. Hear from Ijad Madisch,
      CEO and co-founder of ResearchGate, on how he turned a crazy idea into
      a disruptive technology that's changing the world of science - and why
      we need smarter software frameworks to drive progress.

	    professional network for scientists helps more than 3 million
	    researchers worldwide to collaborate, share their results and make a
	    name for themselves. Madisch has a background in science himself; he
	    studied medicine in Hannover and at Harvard Medical School. Afterwards
	    he spent a few years in Boston, working on an interdisciplinary
	    project at the Department of Radiology at Massachusetts General
	    Hospital. Disappointed by inefficient practices in the research world,
	    he founded ResearchGate together with fellow physician Dr. Sören
	    Hofmayer and IT-specialist Horst Fickenscher in 2008. Since then,
	    ResearchGate has attracted investments from several renown venture
	    capitalists and private investors, among them Bill Gates, Benchmark
	    and Founders Fund. Madisch serves as the company’s President of the
	    Board of Directors.

    <p id="stratosphere_talk"><h3>The Stratosphere Platform for Big Data Analytics, Kostas Tzoumas (TU Berlin)</h3>

    <p>Big Data analysis is diversifying to use cases that require low
      latency and go beyond functionality that naturally fits the MapReduce
      paradigm. We created the Stratosphere platform to support the next
      generation of data analysis needs. Stratosphere is a new parallel data
      management engine that combines a unique set of features for Big Data
      management: it provides a declarative language for the specification
      of data analysis programs, analyzes data “in situ” by embracing
      external data sources (including HDFS), features a rich
      parallelization model that goes beyond MapReduce, and deeply embeds
      user-defined code in the system’s query optimizer and runtime. In
      addition, Stratosphere efficiently executes iterative algorithms,
      widening the use case of such systems to fields such as Machine
      Learning and graph analysis. Stratosphere is compatible with the
      Hadoop ecosystem and is developed by three Universities in the Berlin
      area in Germany, together with a growing open-source developer and
      user community.

    <p id="jens_keynote"><h3>Beyond HDFS Storage in NoSQL Systems, Jens Dittrich (Saarland University)</h3>

    <p>The distributed file system HDFS is a building block for
    several NoSQL systems suchs as Hadoop MapReduce, HBase, and
    Stratosphere. The current version of HDFS, however, is basically a
    block store providing replication-based failover and efficient
    scale-out. In this talk I will give an overview on the HDFS
    replacement HAIL (Hadoop Aggressive Indexing Library) developed at
    Saarland University. HAIL is an extension of HDFS preserving the
    failover and scaling properties of HDFS. However, in addition to
    HDFS, we add automatic index creation at data upoad already,
    adaptive indexing, early map phase execution, as well as storage
    re-balancing. All these techniques come with little to zero
    overhead and can be used with all software layers currently
    operating on HDFS. I will show experimental results demonstrating
    that HAIL provides for efficient index creation and query
    processing simultaneously boosting query times by up to a factor
    60.
